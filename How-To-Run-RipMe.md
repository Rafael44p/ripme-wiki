Make sure you have Java installed. You can download / install it at this site: http://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml

The `ripme.jar` file is actually executable. Java will execute the `.jar` file similarly to how `.exe` files are executed. Usually double-clicking the `.jar` file executes the program.

If double-clicking the `.jar` file does not open the program, you can right-click the file and select an `Open With...` option, then select the `Java` runtime application.

If all else fails, you can run the program via command-line by navigating to the directory and executing
```bash
java -jar ripme.jar
```
